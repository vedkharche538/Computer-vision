##### use of your personal camera for computer vision
<p style="color:red">Using a phone camera with Python is very useful for those who are planning to create computer vision apps that will use a smartphone camera as a part of your application. Here I am using Python on Windows 10. Hope this works for other operating systems as well, but if you are using Windows then don’t worry just follow the steps mentioned below.

The process of using a phone camera with Python:

1.First, install the OpenCV library in Python; pip install opencv-python.<br/>
2.Download and install the IP Webcam application on your smartphones.<br/>
3.After installing the IP Webcam app, make sure your phone and PC are connected to the same network. Run the app on your phone and click Start Server.<br/>
4.After that, your camera will open with an IP address at the bottom. Copy the IP address as we will need to use it in our Python code to open your phone’s camera.<br/>


#### Now let’s code to see how to open a phone camera with Python for the tasks of computer vision
